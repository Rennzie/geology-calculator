# geology-calculator
A toolkit for calculations a field geologist would need


## Why
I'm used to be an exploration geologist, and these calculations are the type of thing I did all the time. There are other softwares out there but non that run in a browser. 


## Goals
Build a toolkit with a crate and web interface for doing basic geology calculations. Something like the old geo-calc but on the web.


## TODO:
- [ ] Build a CLI tool for reading un-oriented drill hole data from CSV and outputting oriented values.
- [ ] Publish a crate that other could use to build similar applications.
- [ ] Build a web interface that uses a WASM compilation of the library to orient drill holes.
- [ ] Use React-three-fibre to build a lower hemisphere equal angle stereo net which has the measurements plotted on it.
